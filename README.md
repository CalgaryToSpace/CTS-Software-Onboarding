### Tutorials
Please complete the following tutorials:

#### STM32 Programming
1. [STM32 Blinky LED Tutorial - Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyZS2p1tW-g&list=PLEBQazB0HUyRYuzfi4clXsKUSgorErmBv)
  * The GPIO pin for the LD2 LED is PB7
2. [STM32 - FreeRTOS Guide - Video](https://www.digikey.ca/en/maker/projects/getting-started-with-stm32-introduction-to-freertos/ad275395687e4d85935351e16ec575b1)
3. [STM32 - I2C & UART Guide - Video](https://youtu.be/isOekyygpR8?si=WwGrYZXlniSiYubi)
  * Use LPUART1 (Pins PG7 and PG8)

#### Git Version Control
Please complete Item 1. Item 2 is a helpful read, which is essentially a review of Item 1, with more practice.

1. [Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop - Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE)
  * Please follow along with the video for practice.
2. [Git and GitHub Desktop - Reading](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-git-and-github-desktop) (optional)
  * In your test repo, try Branching.
3. [Git CLI - Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wr_xPIai-Gg8E0KEQzC6v0hETkPaw800/edit#slide=id.p1) (optional)

## Version Control (Git) Process

#### Commit Message Format:
- Short Title
- Concise Description
- Testing used to verify the change

### Using GitHub Desktop (Recommended)
Download and Install GitHub Desktop (link above)
1) Log in to your GitHub account
2) Select your repository (or clone it from Git)

#### Committing a Change 
If you have made changes, GitHub Desktop willl look something like this:
![changes pic](https://github.com/calgarytospace/OBC_software/blob/Onboarding/Example%20Stuff%20for%20Onboarding/pictures/changes.png?raw=true)

1) Select the boxes which associate with the files whose changes you would like to push forwared onto the repository.
2) Write a description of your commit. Generally speaking, it should be short and concise.
It should now look something like this:
![commit pic](https://github.com/calgarytospace/OBC_software/blob/Onboarding/Example%20Stuff%20for%20Onboarding/pictures/commit.png?raw=true)
3) Press the commit button on the bottom left. This is prompted a change but pushed the change onto the repository (the change is pushed to your local repository)
4) Now, push the `push origin` button on the top right.

Nice, you have just pushed a change. Remember that pushes and commits can be reverted, just search up how to do that.

#### Reviewing a Pull Request:
1) Look over the code and also the commit message. Ensure changes are not out of the scope of the commit message
2) Leave comments for any questions or things you think needs changing
3) If you think its good to submit, comment "Approved"
4) If you think its not good to submit, comment "Revise"


### Using Git Command Line (Not Recommended)
For CalgaryToSpace, **using GitHub Desktop is strongly recommended.**

GitHub Desktop's easy-to-use GUI allows for easier review and inclusion of files for commits. Identifying which files should be comitted in a change is important, as STM32CubeIDE sometimes changes/regenerates files that you do not intend to change.

2) Create a working branch with `git checkout -b MyNewBranch`
3) Make your changes on your branch and stage them with `git add .` to stage all changes. 
4) Commit your changes locally with `git commit -m "description of your commit"`
5) Make as many commit as needed to implement the change/feature 
6) Upload the changes (including your new branch) to GitHub with `git push origin MyNewBranch`
7) Go to the main repo on GitHub where you should now see your new branch
8) Click on your branch name
9) Click on "Pull Request" button to 
10) Click on "Send Pull Request" to development/main 
11) Have Pull request reviewed by 3 people
12) Pull request is good to submit after 3 "Approves"
